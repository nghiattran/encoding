A simple webapp to play with nodejs crypto.

The number of algorithms is based on support algorithms of the host. So on the webpage, there is only around 50 algorithms 
but if you clone the reopo and run `gulp serve`, there can be a lot more than 50. 

On my PC, it can support more than 300 algorithms.
